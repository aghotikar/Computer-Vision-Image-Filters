# Computer-Vision-Image-Filters
This was done as part of the homework assignment for Computer Vision course at http://hi.cs.stonybrook.edu/cse-527.
It has code to equalize a histogram for an image, deconvolute a blurred image, pass it through high and low-pass filters 
and apply Laplacian blending on two images.
