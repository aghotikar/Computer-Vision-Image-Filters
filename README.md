# Computer-Vision-Image-Filters

The goal for this project was to get acquainted with filtering in the spatial domain as well as in the frequency domain.
Laplacian Blending using Image Pyramids is a very good intro to working and thinking in frequencies
and Deconvolution is a neat trick.

The code in this repo does the following:
 1. Performs Histogram Equalization on the given input image
 2. Performs Low-Pass, High-Pass and Deconvolution on the given input image
 3. Performs Laplacian Blending on the two input images
